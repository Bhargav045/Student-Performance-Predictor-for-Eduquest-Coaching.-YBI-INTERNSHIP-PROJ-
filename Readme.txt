Overview
The Student Performance Predictor is a machine learning project developed for EduQuest Coaching to enhance student success through data-driven insights. By analyzing various academic and behavioral factors—such as attendance, previous scores, study hours, and participation—the model predicts each student's final exam performance
This prediction allows EduQuest to:
Identify students at risk of underperforming
Personalize academic support strategies
Improve retention and pass rates
Enable proactive interventions
How It Works
Data Collection
A dataset of 1,000 student records was used, including:
Demographics (gender, age, parental education)
Academic indicators (past scores, attendance, homework rates)
Behavioral factors (class participation, extracurriculars)
Data Preprocessing
Handled categorical variables using encoding
Normalized numerical values
Checked for missing values or anomalies
Model Development
Trained regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting
Evaluated using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
Outcome
The best-performing model accurately predicts final exam scores, enabling targeted academic support.
